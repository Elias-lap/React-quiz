The React Quiz," showcasing the tremendous capabilities of the useReducer Hook. This application is essentially a straightforward quiz centered around React concepts. Initially, we'll load 50 questions from a mock API. Upon starting the quiz, users are presented with a question and four answer options. Progress and points earned are displayed at the top.

Users can select the correct answer, which is promptly marked as such, and proceed to the next question. Conversely, choosing the incorrect option won't affect the correct answer indicator. When we reach the end of the quiz or when the timer expires, the quiz concludes automatically, tallying the points accrued until that point.

All state management, including question selection, point tracking, current question status, and the timer, is efficiently handled by a single comprehensive reducer, aligning with the focus of this section on useReducer.
